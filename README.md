**EMIS Data Analyst Task.**

To work with this repository you first need to merge the files in the observation and medication folders into a single file.

I have worked with Azure data studio for this task.

I have written several queries to solve the task step by step. There are 4 steps.

1 - Getting highest number of patient counts according to the postcode.

2 - Creating PatientObs(temp table) for patients with Asthma diagnosis from the postcode we determined in step 1.

3 - Creating PatientMeds(temo table) for patients that were prescribed certain medicines related to shortness of breath.

4 - Merging both the tables to get the final list of patients.

To understand the queries you can run each of them separately to see the results.
